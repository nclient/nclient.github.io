# NClient
NClient is an HTTP client that allows you to call web service API methods usnig annotated controllers or interfaces. The client supports asynchronous calls, retry policies and logging. All this is  simple and flexible to configure.

## Why use NClient?
Creating clients for web services can be quite a challenge because, in addition to data transfer, you need to implement query building, serialization, retry policy, error handling, logging â€” and this is not to mention the maintenance that comes with each update of your APIs. What if you could create clients with a fraction of the effort? This is exactly what NClient hopes to achieve by allowing you to create clients declaratively.
